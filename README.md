> Green Rewards Ascent to Sustainability Swing

What better way to promote Biodegradable Packaging than to start a reward system on it's usage. Here at G.R.A.S.S, we have built a WebApp where users can scan the QR Codes provided on their Sustainibility Product and attain the Reward Points that come along with it.

## Long description

### What's the problem?

381 million tonnes of plastic waste is produced by the world with in an year currently and it is claimed to be doubled by 2034. Over 50% of this is single use plastic while only 9% has ever been recycled. Around 12.7 million tonnes of plastic yearly is dumped into water while the rest goes to dumping yards where they amount to mountains of garbage. Plastic waste is turning into a major land and ocean pollutant.

### How can technology help?

The only way to control the further input of plastic waste is to normalize the usage of more sustainable products such as online order and courier packaging made out of biodegradable material. This can be obtained when we promote such products and that is where our technology comes to play. 

### The idea

Reward Systems often catalyse the popularisation of healthy habits such as using biodegradable packaging and carry bags instead of plastic ones and that is exactly what G.R.A.S.S does. We will be collaborating with FMCG Companies and Ecommerce companies to use Biodegradable Packacing for their orders and print out QR Codes onto them. Our WebApp has been designed in such a way that users can scan the QR Codes and avail reward points based on what product it is. These Reward points will further be stored onto the user's account and enable them to buy certain online items like a purses, watches, earpods etc as displayed on the Shop Page.
