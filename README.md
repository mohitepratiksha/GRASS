# G.R.A.S.S
> Green Rewards Ascent to Sustainability Swing

What better way to promote Biodegradable Packaging than to start a reward system on it's usage. Here at G.R.A.S.S, we have built a WebApp where users can scan the QR Codes provided on their Sustainibility Product and attain the Reward Points that come along with it.

## Long description

### What's the problem?

381 million tonnes of plastic waste is produced by the world with in an year currently and it is claimed to be doubled by 2034. Over 50% of this is single use plastic while only 9% has ever been recycled. Around 12.7 million tonnes of plastic yearly is dumped into water while the rest goes to dumping yards where they amount to mountains of garbage. Plastic waste is turning into a major land and ocean pollutant.

### How can technology help?

The only way to control the further input of plastic waste is to normalize the usage of more sustainable products such as online order and courier packaging made out of biodegradable material. This can be obtained when we promote such products and that is where our technology comes to play. 

### The idea

Reward Systems often catalyse the popularisation of healthy habits such as using biodegradable packaging and carry bags instead of plastic ones and that is exactly what G.R.A.S.S does. We will be collaborating with FMCG and Ecommerce companies to use Biodegradable Packacing for their orders and print out QR Codes onto them. Our WebApp has been designed in such a way that users can scan the QR Codes and avail reward points based on what product it is. These Reward points will further be stored onto the user's account and enable them to buy certain online items like a purses, watches, earpods etc as displayed on the Shop Page.

## Getting started

> Nishi please tell me Git commands to install this project and how to locally run it

## Built with

IBM Cloud Service: App ID (User Authentication and User Profiles for the WebApp)
Languages for the WebApp: EJS, JavaScript and CSS
For the QR Code Genetator: Python

## Solution Roadmap

1. The webApp is currently only for the costumers while the companies are given separate QR Code Generator Program. We could further improve the WebApp architecture by making two kinds of access, costumer access and company access. Under the Company access, we could incorporate the QR Code Generator and provide the company the statistics of the number of customers who have scanned the QR Codes circulated by their products. This will provide the Company some depth in consumer needs analysis.
2. The QR Code Generator could be made more advanced by adding the QR Codes generated by that in a cloud data base with much more metadata instead of just storing the QR Code ID. We can also make the generator program more personalized based on the companies printer machine.
3. The reward points are currently taken as loyalty points and are then internally converted to the local currency while the user externally buys any product using their reward points. Eventually we could convert our reward points into Crypto Currency inorder to increase the value of our points and keep it more safe.
